# Socionics-App

Socionics based personality type Dating App idea 

I am really interested in Socionics which is a great personality type theory. It is rooted in Carl Jung’s theory of psychological types, but goes further by systematizing how different personality types relate to one another. It is popular in Eastern Europe and I learned it from my executive coach Antonina. I am also very passionate about making online dating less sufferable for women who match with men that have opposite values to them and using this in my daily life has been helpful. 
1. Personality Typing Onboarding
Users take an in-depth socionics diagnostic test (or upload results from a certified external source).


App determines the user's Information Metabolism Type (e.g., LII, EIE, SEE).


Detailed results include type description, cognitive strengths/weaknesses, and romantic behavior.


2. Intertype Compatibility Engine
Uses socionics' theory of dual relations, activity partners, and other intertype dynamics.


Matches are prioritized based on theoretical compatibility, e.g., Duals (ideal), Activity (energetic), Illusionary (interesting but unstable), etc.


Users can customize the matching algorithm: strict dual-only matches, broader intertype relations, or experimental pairings.


3. Intelligent Match Suggestions
Algorithm considers:


Type compatibility


Communication styles


Lifestyle preferences


Relationship goals (e.g., long-term vs. exploration)


Behavioral AI learns over time and refines future matches.


4. Type-Specific Profiles
Profiles show type badges, functional stacks (e.g., Ne-Fi for IEE), and communication advice.


Users get relationship tips for each match based on intertype dynamics.


5. Guided Conversations
Built-in chat prompts based on both users’ types.


Example: For ILE + ESI, prompts that balance exploration with emotional depth



Target Audience
Psychologically self-aware individuals


Fans of MBTI, enneagram, or Jungian theory


People seeking long-term, compatible relationships over casual swiping


Niche dating audiences tired of generic algorithms
